#You can convert radians to degrees by multiplying the radian value by 180/π. Here is a simple Python function that takes in a radian value and returns its equivalent degree value:


import math

def radians_to_degrees(radians):
    return radians * 180 / math.pi

# Test the function with an example value
print(radians_to_degrees(math.pi / 2))
